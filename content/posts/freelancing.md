I have talked a little about freelancing on this blog before, it is often something that is recommended to new developers as a way of gaining experience, getting paid and getting started.

We all know too well the catch 22 of every job needing experience, well, freelance in my opinion is the way to get past that catch 22.

I was lucky enough to find freelance work really early on in my journey, which was great, but it soon dried up which is somewhat normal for freelance work. This is why it is important to find multiple sources of work. I have had a little stroke of luck recently though.

## Ramping Things Up

As I said, I found a freelance gig pretty quickly, a small local company took a chance on me with some basic wordpress work, which was great. However more recently the agency founder has been in touch saying that he likes my work ethic, what I have done so far and is now ready to pass on a much higher workload,this has already started which is great!

We have also discussed the potential of me working there full time in the near future, so that is something to look forward to, but I'm not getting ahead of myself, for now I am just super happy to be being kept busy.

## Finding a Balance

There is one downside to all of this though, being super busy and in front of the laptop most of the day means that finding time to study and keep up with my learning is tough, I need to make time for family and friends, I need to make sure that I don't spend 18 hours a day in front of the computer **BUT** I also need to make sure that I do stay up to date with the industry and keep advancing my skill set.

However, this is definitely a nice problem to have and I am certainly not complaining.
