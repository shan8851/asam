Over the past few weeks I have gotten into kind of a rut and have been managing my time poorly. I sat and had a think about things last night and I realised that this whole programming journey is consuming a big part of my life, which I'm fine with, happy with in fact, but I have realised that the majority of time is not spent writing code....

I seem to be spending more time blogging, writing log, maintaining JS challenges repo and more rather than sitting in front of the laptop writing code.

### Changes Afoot

Now, I'm not saying any of the above is necessarily bad, but adjustments are needed. I need to spend more time building things. That is what is most fun, it is what teaches me the most and has the bonus of having something (hopefully) useful at the end of it all.

### What's On the Agenda?

In the coming weeks I plan to move this blog over to Gatsby, I've talked about my interest in Gatsby before, so I think it's about time I showed my support. This blog will be getting a revamp courtesy of Gatsby and I also plan to have some kind of portfolio too, be that on the same site or two different ones I don't quite know. I'll likely just use some starter template initially while I get used to things and tbh I think they look pretty awesome out of the box.

### Mini Project

I've been pondering various side projects for a little while, most of what I have came up with have been vast apps that are just too big for me to do alone. Over the past 24 hours I have been thinking long and hard about some things that I want to build that are achievable and relatively simple. This will enable me to knock out a few things quickly and get me in the swing again. I hope to build a **Twitter Bot** a **Weather App** and (maybe) a **idea pad** in the next few weeks.

It'll hopefully freshen up my learning, be enjoyable and give me soe interesting talking points for the blog over the coming weeks.
