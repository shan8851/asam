Okay, so I know I said I was gonna write a post about cool resources next, but tbh there is so many out there that it might be a little counter productive, so I have decided to just link to one of my favourites.

Check it out [here](https://zero-to-mastery.github.io/resources/), you will also soon find it linked up in the navigation area.

This list is constantly being updated and was created by students from the Zero to Mastery web development course on Udemy, which includes myself 😃. I will talk a lot more about zero to mastery, which will now be referred to as ZTM in future posts, but for now I thought I would just stick this link out there for people looking for some great resources.

I will likely make a post about my top picks in the next week or two, so please keep an eye out for that.
