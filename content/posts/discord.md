description: "Following on from my last post I decided to make it easier for you to get in touch. I have created a Discord Server for people who are new to web development where I will offer as much help as I can. Hopefully long term this server can attract more experienced people who can help with more advanced topics and in time I will be able to do this also. As long as everyone does their bit to help others it should have no problem growing into a helpful little community."

Following on from my last post I decided to make it easier for you to get in touch. I have created a Discord Server for people who are new to web development where I will offer as much help as I can. Hopefully long term this server can attract more experienced people who can help with more advanced topics and in time I will be able to do this also. As long as everyone does their bit to help others it should have no problem growing into a helpful little community.

If you would like to join then please use [this invite link](https://discord.gg/ns8GH3g)

**UPDATE - The server really didn't take off, I will possibly revisit this again when there is a demand for it, but if you need help please do reach out**
