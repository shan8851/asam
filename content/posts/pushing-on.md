I wrote a post about habits recently, I am happy to say that for the most part all of these habits have been continuing to go well, in particular my learning. I have often thought about working through growth slumps before. I asked my mentor Corey about it and he ended up writing a blog post about it, so rather than try recreate I figured I would share it [here](https://bttrdvlpr.io/post/input-on-getting-over-growth-slumps/).

## Keep Going

The main takeaway is always be doing something, always be working. Obviously I don't literally mean always, life can always (and often does) get in the way, but as long as you can get back on task when you have the time you will improve dramatically. You will hit road blocks, fee like quitting and it very often won't be easy trying to do all of this with your regular job, but the pay off will be worth it in the end.

## Where To Begin?

Often people say they don't know what to learn, which I think is a little meh... I mean learn what you are interested in, learn something you get stuck on regularly, learn what technologies your more senior colleagues do etc, it shouldn't be too difficult.

If you are really struggling one great way is to look at jobs for senior developers. See what the job spec asks for, try find some with a really detailed profile and read what is expected of seniors in your space.

That is then literally your roadmap to becoming the senior dev.

Good Luck!
